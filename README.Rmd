## Overview

The goal of `filtro` is to apply filter-based supervised feature selection methods prior to modeling. These methods assess the relevance of feature using statistical metrics such as p-values, correlation coefficients, importance scores, and information gain. This package offers tools to score, rank, and select top features using built-in functions and the [desirability2](https://desirability2.tidymodels.org) package, and supports use on its own or within tidymodels workflows.

## Installation

You can install the released version of filtro from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! 
```

You can install the development version from Github with:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! 
```

## A scoring example

## A filtering exmple using a single score

## A filtering example using multiple scores
