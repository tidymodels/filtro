## Overview

`filtro` is tidy tools to apply filter-based supervised feature
selection methods. These methods score and rank feature relevance
using metrics such as p-values, correlation, importance scores,
and more.

`filtro` provides functions to rank and select a top number or proportion
of features using built-in methods and the
[desirability2](https://desirability2.tidymodels.org) package, and 
supports streamlined preprocessing, either standalone or within tidymodels
workflows such as the [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org) package. 

## Installation
