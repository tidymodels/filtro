## Overview

The goal of `filtro` is to apply filter-based supervised feature selection methods. These methods score feature relevance using metrics such as p-values, correlation, and importance scores. 

The package offers tools to score, rank, and select top features using built-in functions and the [desirability2](https://desirability2.tidymodels.org) package, and supports streamlined preprocessing on its own or within tidymodels workflows like the [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org) package. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of themis from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("filtro")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/filtro")
```

## A scoring example

## A filtering exmple using a single score
